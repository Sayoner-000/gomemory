## [2.8.0] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- **`mem usage`** — a measured token benchmark per session. Reports baseline
  tokens (what a response would have cost unoptimized), emitted tokens, the
  saved delta and reduction ratio, broken down by operation and by channel
  (`mcp`, `cli`, `tui`). Available as `mem usage [--session ID|--all] [--json]`.
  The header always declares that the counting method is a neutral
  approximation (~4 chars/token), not any provider's tokenizer — figures are
  comparable against themselves, never against anyone's billing. An optional
  reference-window setting (`usage_window_tokens`, off by default) adds an
  estimated "footprint avoided" percentage, clearly labeled `(estimated)`.
  Machine-readable contract: [`docs/USAGE-REPORT-CONTRACT.md`](docs/USAGE-REPORT-CONTRACT.md).
- **Usage screen in the interactive UI** (`u` key) — shows the same session
  report as `mem usage`, plus an on-demand context-optimization snapshot for
  a specific task (same engine as `mem pack build`), which never persists
  between visits.
- **`mem consolidate [--apply]`** — merges redundant memories within a
  project by two criteria: shared topic key, and automatic activity
  checkpoints with byte-identical content. Previews by default (the
  operation is irreversible); no content is lost, distinct text within a
  merged group is concatenated into the row that's kept. Also available from
  the interactive UI's Maintenance screen.
- **`mem get <id>`** — retrieves a memory's full detail by ID from the
  command line, mirroring the `get_memory` MCP tool's capability on the CLI
  channel.
- **Index mode for `get_context`** (`context_index_mode` setting, off by
  default) — emits the working protocol in full plus a one-line index per
  memory (id, type, title), with detail fetched on demand via the existing
  `get_memory` capability. Reversible: toggling it off returns emission to
  byte-identical output.

### Changed

- `charmbracelet/bubbletea` v0.26.1 → v1.3.10, `bubbles` v0.18.0 → v1.0.0,
  `lipgloss` v1.0.0 → v1.1.0. No application code changes were needed; every
  existing screen and test kept its exact behavior.

### Fixed

- **MCP usage-recording middleware never fired.** The fallback middleware
  that records non-self-reporting tool calls (`save_memory`, `get_memory`,
  and others) type-asserted the request params to `*mcp.CallToolParams`, but
  the SDK hands middlewares the *unparsed* params (`*mcp.CallToolParamsRaw`)
  — the assertion silently failed for every call. Found by an end-to-end
  test that drives a real MCP client against the real server, not a
  schema-listing check. Fixed and covered by two new integration tests.
- `search_memories`/`list_memories` usage accounting could report emitted
  tokens higher than baseline tokens for short memories, because the raw
  baseline only summed memory content and ignored the rendered wrapper
  (id/type/title/formatting). Baseline is now derived as emitted + what was
  actually truncated, guaranteeing baseline ≥ emitted.
- `ListAllMemories` never selected the `topic_key` column, so every memory
  loaded through it appeared to have no topic key regardless of what was
  stored — this silently broke topic-key grouping before it was ever used.
- `mem usage`'s "no session" report collapsed with the "all sessions"
  report internally (both used an empty session ID), so an idle project
  could show accumulated historical totals instead of zeros.
